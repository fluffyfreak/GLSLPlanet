GLSLPlanet
==========

This is my attempt to create an environment where I could work on several things.

1. The GeoSphere code from Pioneer Space Sim (https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer) without the rest of Pioneer!
2. GLSL generation of heightmaps using Framebuffer Objects and rendering to textures.
